    "### ðŸš€ Deep Learning Insights from Week 8\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, I dived deep into the fascinating world of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful tool for analyzing visual imagery. Here are some key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Layers of Learning: The journey through CNNs took me through four integral layers - the convolution layer, the ReLU layer, the pooling layer, and the dense layer. Each layer plays a unique role in extracting and interpreting features from images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leveraging Transfer Learning: I explored the concept of transfer learning, where I retain the knowledge gained from the convolutional layers and train new dense layers to adapt to our specific task. This approach allows me to harness pre-existing neural networks to accelerate my learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout Technique: I implemented the Dropout technique, a robust method that enhances the generalization of our neural networks. By randomly dropping nodes of a layer during training, we prevent overfitting and improve the modelâ€™s performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Augmentation: Lastly, I delved into Data Augmentation, a technique that artificially increases our dataset size by generating new images from existing ones. By introducing minor alterations such as flipping, cropping, and adjusting brightness/contrast, we can enrich our dataset and improve model robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stay tuned for more exciting updates as I continue our deep learning journey! ðŸ’¡"

    "Dataset\n",
    "In this homework, we'll build a model for predicting if we have an image of a bee or a wasp. For this, we will use the \"Bee or Wasp?\" dataset that was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jerzydziewierz/bee-vs-wasp) and slightly rebuilt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saturn Cloud to run the code\n",
    "Model\n",

    "You need to develop the model with following structure:\n",

    "- The shape for input should be `(150, 150, 3)` \n",
    "- Next, create a convolutional layer `(Conv2D)`: \n",
    "    - Use 32 filters \n",
    "    - Kernel size should be `(3, 3)` (that's the size of the filter) \n",
    "    - Use `'relu'` as activation \n",
    "- Reduce the size of the feature map with max pooling `(MaxPooling2D)` \n",
    "    - Set the pooling size to `(2, 2)` \n",
    "- Turn the multi-dimensional result into vectors using a `Flatten` layer \n",
    "- Next, add a `Dense` layer with 64 neurons and `'relu'` activation \n",
    "- Finally, create the `Dense` layer with 1 neuron - this will be the output \n",
    "    - The output layer should have an activation - use the appropriate activation for the binary classification case \n",
    "- As optimizer use `SGD` with the following parameters:\n",
    "    - `SGD(lr=0.002, momentum=0.8)`"
